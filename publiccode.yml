    shortDescription: Authentication and Authorization Component
    longDescription: >
      This tool is provided on behalf of the SPRINT project. SPRINT project
      intends to prepare a kit that enhances and re-uses some components
      developed by the SIMPATICO project.


      The Authentication and Authorization Component (AAC) provides support for
      the OAuth2.0 authentication protocol and acts as an authorization server
      for access to platform resources and APIs. 


      It also mediates identity provisioning activities, allowing integration
      with city or national specific authentication systems through its modular
      architecture. It provides immediate integration of Google and Facebook
      authentication systems.


      AAC component is distributed as a Java web application in a standard JEE
      container (eg Apache Tomcat). 
    features:
      - Authentication
      - Authorization
